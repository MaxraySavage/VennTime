# VennTime
A platform for users to find the best common time to meet!

## Motivation
As a LaunchCode student, Maxray had trouble organizing study times for a large group. They tried a couple existing services but all had strong drawbacks either in functionality or design. VennTime will allow any group of people to find the best time for them to study, have a party or go get dinner! Users will be able to easily create an event and solicit availability from friends. Everyone is included. Everyone wins.
